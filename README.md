# Agriculture-Portal-Flood-Prediction

Agriculture Portal is a machine learning-based project for farmers. The system uses different algorithms to predict crops, recommend fertilizers, and provide rainfall 
and yield predictions to help farmers make informed decisions about their crops. We use Decision Trees ( With Gini Impuirty) and Random Forest Machine Learning Model
to ensure the best accuracy for our project. 
We also use the weather data to predict flood using an IOT with an ultrasonice sensor with SMS functionality.
